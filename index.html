Creating a new game will generate a different mine configuration for each time.
You the player can flag squares you believe are mines.
Each flag you place counts against the total mine count.
This mean that if you use all of your flags and there are still undiscovered mines you lose.
At any time you can remove a flag previously placed.
Each game will display the number of mines that have been placed, and your corresponding flag choices.
Once you have marked all of the mines the game is over and you win!
If you click a square with zero bombs adjacent to it the game will reveal that square as well as any other adjacent square that is not touching a mine.
The game will indicate how many mines are next to a square that has not been revealed.
You the player, can choose the size of your game puzzle and the relative number of mines.
* Remember if a mine is clicked, if all non-mine squares are revealed, or all mine squares are correctly flagged the game will end.

* click open frame with design info 
* some way to start game (button or link) 
* separate page or a section in the description page 
* break down of different levels of game you can do 
* Size options: (10x10, 30x30, 75x75) 
* Number of bombs 10% or hard numbers (size + %), user selectable numbers


				<br>Size options: (10x10, 30x30, 75x75)
				<br>Number of bombs: 5%-10% of number of cells
				<br>examples:	10x10 = 100
				<br> -- # bombs would be 5-10
				<br>
				<br>Size options: (10x10, 30x30, 75x75)
				<br>Number of bombs 10% or hard numbers (size + %), user selectable numbers
				<br>
				<br>Need to use the following: links, headers, lines, lists, other as needed
				<br/>
				VDescription page should have at least one image of game play

				Stage 3:
						algorithm and code to generate

				</pre>
				<pre>Game element break down:
				Game board (size determined on user selection on creation)
				Mines generated (number determined on user selection on creation)
				Minesweeper The program generates a different mine configuration for each game.
					Random location placement of mines for each game
				The player can flag squares as mines, player can also un-flag squares
					Ability for user to set a flag
					Ability to remove a flag
					Number of flags equal to initial number of mines
						count updates based on placement or removal
			 		Flagged squares should be indicated by an appropriate image
			 		Revealed mines should be represented by an appropriate image
			 	The program displays number of mines in the game
			 	The program displays number of mines that have been flagged at any given time
			 	The program displays number of mines left to find based on previous two stats
			 	Behind the scenes field values
			 		field with no bombs adjacent = 0
			 		field with 1 bombs adjacent = 1
			 		field with 2 bombs adjacent = 2
			 		ect...
			 	If a zero square is clicked, all adjacent zero squares (recursively) are also revealed
			 	All non-zero squares adjacent to the revealed zero squares are also revealed **
			 		** revealed means that the square displays a number of how many bombs are adjacent to it
			 	The player can choose the size of the puzzle
			 	The player can choose the number of mines (within the given para-dime described above)
			 	The program displays a message when the game is over
			 		Game ends when:
			 			a mine is clicked, player loses
			 			all non-mine squares have been revealed **, player wins
			 			all mine squares are correctly flagged, player wins
