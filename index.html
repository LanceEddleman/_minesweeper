<pre>How the Game is played:
	Minesweeper The program generates a different mine configuration for each game. The player can flag squares in the grid as mines, and can also change a square back to being un-flagged. Flagged squares should be indicated by an appropriate image, and revealed mines should also be represented by images. The program tells how many mines are in the grid and displays the number of mines that have been flagged at any given time. If a zero square is clicked, all adjacent zero squares (recursively) are also revealed. All non-zero squares adjacent to the revealed zero squares are also revealed. The player can choose the size of the puzzle and the number of mines. The program displays a message when the game is over (a mine is clicked, or all non-mine squares have been revealed and all mine squares are correctly flagged).

<div>this is where the page frame goes
	<pre>
		section description - <a href="psd.html">Preliminary Software Design</a>
		
		game brief description
			Size options: (10x10, 30x30, 75x75)
			Number of bombs: 5%-10% of number of cells
			examples:	10x10 = 100
						# bombs would be 5-10

		Size options: (10x10, 30x30, 75x75)
		Number of bombs 10% or hard numbers (size + %), user selectable numbers

		need to use the following: links, headers, lines, lists, other as needed
		<br/>
		description page should have at least one image of game play
		<br/>
		game to open in separate window (grid in new window)  make this optional
	</pre>

	<br/>
	game and description page should use font family, size, color, backgrounds, borders, margins, padding, ect
	<br/>

	<pre>Stage 1:
			Welcome page
				game definition
			Game page
				basic grid for game
				pho game displayed in a in game state
	Stage 2:
			menu structure for user game choices
			basic engine to create game grid
			variables needed to pass user selection to grid creation
	Stage 3:
			algorithm and code to generate

	</pre>
	<pre>Game element break down:
	Game board (size determined on user selection on creation)
	Mines generated (number determined on user selection on creation)
	Minesweeper The program generates a different mine configuration for each game.
		Random location placement of mines for each game
	The player can flag squares as mines, player can also un-flag squares
		Ability for user to set a flag
		Ability to remove a flag
		Number of flags equal to initial number of mines
			count updates based on placement or removal
 		Flagged squares should be indicated by an appropriate image
 		Revealed mines should be represented by an appropriate image
 	The program displays number of mines in the game
 	The program displays number of mines that have been flagged at any given time
 	The program displays number of mines left to find based on previous two stats
 	Behind the scenes field values
 		field with no bombs adjacent = 0
 		field with 1 bombs adjacent = 1
 		field with 2 bombs adjacent = 2
 		ect...
 	If a zero square is clicked, all adjacent zero squares (recursively) are also revealed
 	All non-zero squares adjacent to the revealed zero squares are also revealed **
 		** revealed means that the square displays a number of how many bombs are adjacent to it
 	The player can choose the size of the puzzle
 	The player can choose the number of mines (within the given para-dime described above)
 	The program displays a message when the game is over
 		Game ends when:
 			a mine is clicked, player loses
 			all non-mine squares have been revealed **, player wins
 			all mine squares are correctly flagged, player wins
