<h2>Sample Preliminary Software Design</h2>

<p>
This is a sample preliminary software design for the card game Hearts.
Since it's not a grid-based game, this isn't a game that you can do
for your project, but this page should give you a good idea of what
your preliminary software design should look like.
</p>

<p>
If you're not familiar with the game of Hearts, you can read about it
here:

<h3>Model</h3>

<h4>Constants</h4>

<b>MIN_PLAYERS</b> the minimum number of players in the game (3)
<br>
<b>MAX_PLAYERS</b> the maximum number of players in the game (7)
<br>

<table>
<tr><td style="border-bottom: thin solid gray"><b>Suits</b></td><td>&nbsp;</td><br>
<tr><td>HEARTS</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>DIAMONDS</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>CLUBS</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>SPADES</td><td>3</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Even though numeric values are specified for suits, nothing in the program
should depend on these specific values.
</p>


<p>
Ranks from 2 to 10 will be represented by integer values.
The ranks defined below should have the numeric values specified below
so that they will work with the other ranks.
<br>

<table>
<tr><td style="border-bottom: thin solid gray">
         <b>Ranks</b></td><td>&nbsp;</td><br>
<tr><td>JACK</td><td>11</td></tr>
<tr><td>QUEEN</td><td>12</td></tr>
<tr><td>KING</td><td>13</td></tr>
<tr><td>ACE</td><td>14</td></tr>
</table>
</p>
<br>

The following types of objects will be used in the game:
<br>

<p>
<b>Card</b><br>
Each Card object will have a <b>suit</b> property and a <b>rank</b>
property.
<br>

<ul><li>
<b>suit</b> one of the following values: HEARTS, DIAMONDS, CLUBS, SPADES
</li><li>
<b>rank</b> a number in the range 2 to 14.
The variables JACK, QUEEN, KING, and ACE can be used for ranks in the
range of 11 to 14.
</li></ul>
</p>

<p>
Card object examples:<br>
<tt>{"rank": 2, "suit": CLUBS}</tt><br>
<tt>{"rank": QUEEN, "suit": SPADES}</tt><br>
<tt>{"rank": ACE, "suit": HEARTS}</tt><br>
</p>
<br>

<p>
<b>PlayedCard</b><br>
Each PlayedCard object will have a <b>suit</b> property and a <b>rank</b>
property.
<br>

<ul><li>
<b>card</b> a Card object
</li><li>
<b>playerNumber</b> a player number (index into the players property
of Game objects)
</li></ul>
</p>

<p>
PlayedCard object example<br>
<tt>{"card": {"rank": 2, "suit": CLUBS}, "playerNumber": 2}</tt><br>
(Assumes there are at least three players in the game.)
</p>
<br>

<p>
<b>Player</b><br>
Each Player object will have the following properties:
<ul><li>
<b>number</b>: integer
</li><li>
<b>name</b>: string<br>
</li><li>
<b>hand</b>: array of Card objects (usually 17 or fewer cards)<br>
</li><li>
<b>discard</b>: array of PlayedCard objects (zero to 52 cards)<br>
</li><li>
<b>score</b>: a non-negative integer <br>
</li></ul>
</p>
<br>

<p>
<b>Game</b><br>
Each Game object will have the following properties:
<ul><li>
<b>players</b> an array of Player objects (no fewer than MIN_PLAYERS
  and not more than MAX_PLAYERS).
Player numbers are indexes into this array.
</li><li>
<b>deck</b> an array of Card objects (zero to 52 cards).
</li><li>
<b>trick</b> an array of Card objects (not more than MAX_PLAYERS).
</li><li>
<b>nextToLead</b>: a Player number<br>
</li><li>
<b>nextToPlay</b>: a Player number<br>
</li><li>
<b>endScore</b>: a positive integer that is the score a player needs
to win the game<br>
</li></ul>
</p>
<br>

<h4>Functions/Methods</h4>

The following functions could be methods of Game, Player, or Card objects, but will be
described as standalone functions here.
<br><br>

<p>
<b>deal()</b><br>
Creates a full deck, shuffles the deck, and puts cards in the
<b>hand</b> array property of each player.
(To ensure that all players have the same number of cards, some cards
will be removed from the deck if there are 3, 5, 6, or 7 players.)
</p>

<p>
<b>playCard(player, card)</b><br>
Takes a player object and a card object as parameters.
Determines whether the card can be legally played.
If the specified card can be legally played, the card and the
specified player's number are put into PlayedCard object which is
added to the <b>trick</b> property of the current Game object.
The card is removed from the hand of the player.
</p>

<p>
<b>endTrick()</b><br>
Determines which player won the trick according to the rules of the
game.
(The player who played the card of the highest rank of the lead suit
wins the trick.)
The PlayedCard objects from the <b>trick</b> property of the current Game
object are appended to the <b>discard</b> array of the player who won the
trick.
The <b>nextToLead</b> property of the Game object is set to the number of the
player who won the trick.
All PlayedCard objects are removed from the <b>trick</b> array.
</p>

<p>
<b>endHand()</b><br>
Calculates the score for the hand for each player based on the discard
property of the player.
Adds the hand score to the player's total score.
game.
(The player who played the card of the highest rank of the lead suit
wins the trick.)
The PlayedCard objects from the <b>trick</b> property of the current Game
object are appended to the <b>discard</b> array of the player who won the
trick.
The <b>nextToLead</b> property of the Game object is set to the number of the
player who won the trick.
</p>

<h3>NOTES</h3>
<p>
--There is <em>no information</em> in the model about how things will look in the
browser.
This same model could be used in a game that had a text interface or
in a game with animated 3D models.
<br><br>
--I haven't described all of the variables and functions that will be
used in the model, but I have described enough of them to decide that this
approach will probably work well.
<br><br>
--JavaScript doesn't have constants, so the "constants" will actually be
defined as variables but the program won't change their values.
<br><br>
--All of the names (of variables and functions) defined for this game
could be defined in a single global object to avoid namespace
collisions with libraries and frameworks.
