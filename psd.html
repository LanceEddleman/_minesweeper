Functions needed for dame design and functionality

<p>
Your game description page (index.html) should include a heading for Preliminary Software Design, followed by a description of your model and the most important functions that your game will need. The descriptions of the model and the functions should be programming-language independent. Alternatively, you can put the preliminary software design in a separate HTML file and put a link to it on the game description page. You will not receive full credit for the preliminary software design if it is not in HTML format.

	For the model, describe the kinds of objects and arrays that you think will work well for representing game data. You can use (simple) UML to describe the objects, or you can write English descriptions of the data and methods that the objects will have. Descriptions of objects should include names and types of

their properties (or instance variables). Descriptions of arrays should include the type of element in the array and should include information about how many elements will be in the array.
For functions, state the name of the function and the types of parameters it will have. Also include a brief description, in English or pseudocode, of what the function will do.
The description of the model is the most important part of the preliminary software design. In Assignment 3, I will ask you to write JavaScript code that initializes your game grid with data from the model, so it will be very helpful to have a good idea of what that model will be like. For example, for Battleship you would need to have a model that tells where ships are placed, and then write JavaScript code to use information from the model to display ships in the HTML for the game grid.

Be sure that you use relative URLs for the values of hrefattributes of link tags and srcattributes of image tags. If you use an absolute URL that refers to a file in a location on your computer, the browser will not load the HTTML file or image when I grade your assignment on my computer, and you won't get credit for the link or image.
<br/>
Here are examples of relative and absolute URLs in link tags:
<br/>
Relative: a href="gameGrid.html"
<br/>
Absolute: a href="file:///C:/Users/Abigail/Documents/CS2550/A1/gameGrid.html"
<br/>
The problem with the absolute URL is that it can be used only on a computer that has the exact path C://Users/Abigail/Documents/CS2550/A1/, which my computer (and most others) doesn't have. The relative URL will work fine on any computer, as long as the HTML file (gameGrid.html) is in the same directory as the web page that contains the link.
